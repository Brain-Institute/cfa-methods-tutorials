# Cove Neurosciences - Methods Tutorial

This is a CfA Method Tutorial based on the project titled: Connectivity-based neuroanalytics of large neurodevelopmental cohorts for subgroup identification

This repository contains the code used to analyze the POND data release from OBI by Cove Neurosciences. We specifically investigated the ability of novel machine learning (ML) approaches to capture differences in network dynamics between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or typical development (TD) using either magnetoencephalography (MEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In summary, we found that these three groups could be separated using our unsupervised ML approach, and that characteristics of dynamic (i.e., spatiotemporal) networks on both MEG and fMRI. Furthermore, these network dynamics corresponded to clinical characteristics as detailed by the Strengths and Weaknesses of the ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior Scale (SWAN), as evaluated using sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA).
